We deprecated this example since the approach illustrated here is not compatible with the inner GridLookUpEdit core mechanism. Use the approach from the <a href="https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/how-to-provide-the-multiselect-functionality-for-gridlookupedit-t191038">How to provide the MultiSelect functionality for GridLookUpEdit</a> example instead.
